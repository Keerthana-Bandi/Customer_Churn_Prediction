Online Churn prediction for the data set from Kaggle using 
1. Mode - Missing Values imputation
2. Smote - Class imbalance
3. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting for Churn Predicton
4. Evaluated the Results with Recall, ROC, Accuracy for Train and Test data
5. Saved the Decision Tree Model in pickle file
6. Xtrain as reference data
7. using reference data and pickle file in app.py deployed the model to Fast API
8. Fast API - connects to swagger UI - http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/
9. Implemented Evidently AI for Drift detection
10. Drift report can be downloaded from the sawger UI
